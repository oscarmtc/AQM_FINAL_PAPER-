``` {r Load the main data source}

data <- fread("spanish_political_attitudes_dataset_2017_to_2020.csv")

# in order to use the "fread" function we first have to download the "data.table" package. This function is mainly employed for reading data from external files into R (in this case, the main data in in a csv format) in the form of data tables. It is especially useful when it comes to reading large datasets. 

dim(data) # we inspect the dimensions of the data: it has a total of 7850 observations (each observation corresponds to a panelist) and 37 variables. 

summary(data) # Overview of the data 

```

``` {r Code for the Preparation of the Data}

# This initial code chunk has the purpose of preparing the data for the latter statistical analysis. The preparation steps conducted stem from the replication material of "Sexism and the far-right vote: The individual dynamics of gender backlash." Although the initial replication code is available for STATA, we rewrite the code for R. Although some commands may be different and some steps may be either added or removed, the variables resulting (as well as their scales and coding schemes) should be exactly the same.
